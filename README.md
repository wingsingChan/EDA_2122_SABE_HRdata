# Environmental Data Analysis - Datasets for Lab 2 on the Distribution and Descriptive Statistics

This is a repository containing dataset collected by Mr. Chan Wing Sing as part of his research study on the spatial ecology of freshwater turtles in Hong Kong. The presented dataset has modified accordingly to and are intended only for the purpose of teaching for an undergraduate course - ENVS2002 Environmental Data Analysis at the University of Hong Kong. 

## Project Description
We monitored the movement pattern, and habitat use of S. bealei through radio telemetry from June 2020 to May 2021. All study animals will be outfitted with a radio transmitter (model SOPR-2190; model SOPR-2038, Wildlife Materials International Inc., Illinois) with the use of epoxy putty glue. Relocation data of each tagged individual will be collected two to four times per week using a telemetry receiver (IC-R10, ICOM Inc., Kirdland, WA) and a 3-element Yagi antenna (Biotrack Ltd. Wareham, United Kingdom). Tracking events will alternate between day and night. At each radio location, location of individual turtle will be determined by triangulation and identified with a GPS coordinate using Garman GPSMAPÂ® 62s. Date, time, weather information, habitat type, microhabitat measurements and behaviour of individual turtles will also be recorded.

## Dataset Description
The file `SABE_homerange2.csv` in the repository contains __biometric data__ and __home range characterization__ of _S. bealei_ measured during the period lasting from May 2020 to Aug 2021. Variables include the followings, 

- `ID` is a unique number assigned for each captured individual and identified through a marginal scale notching system developed by Cagle (1939).

- `Sex` is differentiated by visual examination of the secondary sexual characteristics into female (F) and male (M) for adults. Individuals whose measured carapace length smaller than 90 mm were otherwise considered juvenile (J). 

- `CL` is the straight-line carapace length measured using a caliper at the start of the tracking period for each monitored turtle. Measurement unit is in millimeter (mm).

- `PL` is the straight-line plastron length measured using a caliper at the start of the tracking period for each monitored turtle. Measurement unit is in millimeter (mm). 

- `Wt` is the body mass of individual turtle weighted using an electronic balance at the start of the tracking period. Measurment unit is in gram (g).

- `Season` was categorised based on the environmental condition in Hong Kong and the biological timing of _S. bealei_, and was divided into 5 mutually exclusive categories (2020 Wet Season, 2020 Mating Season, 2020 Dry Season, 2021 Nesting Season, and 2021 Wet Season). 

- `StartDate` and `EndDate` indicate the period of the defined season. 

- `HR_Type` specifies the method used for estimation of the home range type. Here, the dataset only included the home ranges estimated using minimum convex polygon (MCP). 

- `MCP_Lv` defines the percentage of the points used for the drawing of the MCP. Here, only 100% MCPs are presented in the dataset

- `Area_m2` is the calculated home range size for the corresponding individuals of the specified season. Note foraging periods for the calculated home range size may not
